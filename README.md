# Linkify

Angular, Tailwind-CSS, external package for colour picker

My first serious project started from scratch.
Made for portfolio and own usage.

Also you can find flutter mobile app for Linkify:
https://github.com/SavchenkoIllya/Linkify-flutter-app

And backend part of this project:
https://github.com/SavchenkoIllya/Linkify-app-server

All project was made on stack:
Angular, MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, Flutter

Idea of this app to save links with preview. Like a small notation app with elements of social network.

Lot's of optimization in progress and some reworks in plans.
